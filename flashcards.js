      question: "Lymphatic Drainage of the Lungs",
      description: `• Drains the bronchial tree, pulmonary vessels, and connective tissue septa.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Pulmonary Trunk",
      description: `• Arises from the right ventricle (conus arteriosus).
  • Carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs.
  • Divides into right and left pulmonary arteries at the sternal angle.
  • Has low blood pressure and lies inside the fibrous pericardium.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Left Pulmonary Artery",
      description: `• Carries deoxygenated blood to the left lung.
  • Shorter and narrower than the right.
  • Passes over the left primary bronchus.
  • Connected to the aortic arch by the ligamentum arteriosum.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Right Pulmonary Artery",
      description: `• Runs horizontally to the right lung hilum.
  • Lies behind the ascending aorta and SVC.
  • Passes anterior to the right bronchus.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Pulmonary Veins",
      description: `• Five veins (one from each lung lobe).
  • Located between segments (do NOT follow bronchi).
  • Carry mostly oxygenated blood to the left atrium.
  • Also drain visceral pleura and some bronchioles.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Bronchial Arteries",
      description: `• Arise from the thoracic aorta.
  • Usually 1 right, 2 left.
  • Supply oxygenated blood to bronchi and visceral pleura.
  • Form anastomoses with pulmonary vessels.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Bronchial Veins",
      description: `• Drain bronchi.
  • Empty into:
    - Azygos vein (right)
    - Accessory hemiazygos or superior intercostal vein (left)`,
    },
    {
      question: "Pulmonary Plexus",
      description: `• Formed by:
    - Vagus nerve (parasympathetic)
    - Sympathetic trunk fibers
  • Divided into anterior and posterior plexuses.
  • Nerves follow bronchi and vessels into the lung.
  Effects:
  • Sympathetic → bronchodilation, vasoconstriction
  • Parasympathetic → bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, ↑ secretion`,
    },
    {
      question: "Phrenic Nerve",
      description: `• Origin: C3–C5
  • Runs anterior to lung root (vagus runs posterior).
  • Supplies:
    - Diaphragm (motor)
    - Pericardium & pleura (sensory)
  • Enters thorax under subclavian vein.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Pulmonary Embolism (PE)",
      description: `• Definition: Sudden blockage of a pulmonary artery by a thrombus (usually from deep veins of the leg).
  • Most common source: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
  • Symptoms:
    - Cough
    - Coughing up blood
    - Loss of consciousness
    - Wheezing
    - Dull chest pain
    - Pain in calf or thigh
    - Unexplained shortness of breath`,
